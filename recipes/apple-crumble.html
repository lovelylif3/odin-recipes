    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Apple crumble is one of my favorite easy to make desserts. Reminiscent of cobbler,
        the crumbly topping with oats makes it seem... healthier? Let's not kid ourselves here,
        this is a decadent dessert to induldge in. This classic dessert consists of tender, 
        cinnamon-spiced apples, topped with a buttery, crumbly streusel. With its warm, 
        inviting aroma and delightful combination of flavors and textures, apple crumble 
        is a quintessential fall treat that can be enjoyed all year round.
