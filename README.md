This is my first project on GitHub - a simple recipe site written in HTML.

By creating this site, I hope to demostrate my newfound knowledge of the Git workflow,
writing good commit messages, organizing website files, editing text with tags like <strong>
and <em>, absolute and relative links to sites and utilizing images.
